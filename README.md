Hey, thanks for reading this!

In this mod, I attempted to turn Quake 4 into Rock-Paper-Scissors.

My project-specific deliverables were:

D1- Implement Rock-Paper-Scissors mechanics (DONE)
D2- Implement 5 enemies with their own behaviors (DONE)
D3- Add 5 items to make it easier to win (DONE)
D4- Implement loot drops (DONE)
D5- High score list (DONE-ish)


To test the deliverables:

D1- Press [space] to initiate a battle against a random foe. Then (preferrably after the "SHOOT!" mark), choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors using [A], [W], or [D], respectively.

D2- It may be somewhat hard to notice, but enemies will prefer certain moves. Grunts, for instance, almost always pick Rock, and if not, they pick Paper. (They're too dumb to remember Scissors is an option, haha.) All but two of the enemies can "cheat". By that I mean, if you pick your option too early, they will pick the move that beats yours. 

D3- Items! We all love a good powerup! There are 5 items, bound to the keys [1], [2], [3], [4], and [5]. Listed here are what they are and what they do:

I1: Instakillers can be used to instantly beat the current foe and get a point. They're rare, so save them for that special occasion!
I2: Anticheats impair the current foe's thinking, making them unable to cheat! (This item is wasted if used on a foe that can't cheat in the first place...)
I3: Morphers are new technology that transforms the current foe into a different one! Useful if you can't figure out their move preference.
I4: Syncers are interesting gadgets that synchronise the foe's brain with your own! Makes you unable to lose the current bout. However, if it's a draw it'll wear off, and you won't be able to use another one on the current foe.
I5: Medkits heal you by 20HP, which will keep you alive longer. Enough said.

D4- Loot drops, where else are you gonna get more items? (Some of them you don't even start with!) Each enemy has two types of drops: Common drops (40% chance), and Rare drops (10% chance). (The drops are mutually exclusive, meaning you can't get both drops from one enemy.) Some enemies will even give you more than one item in a drop! (psst, go to the bottom of this page to figure out how to maximize your gains, this is not a scam!)

D5- Unfortunately, I couldn't get the high scores to display them in-game, but there is a file you can check after your first game-over, see "highscores.txt".


For any additional help, or to be reminded what the items do, hold [TAB].
